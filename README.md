# Forest Cover Reporting Tool

This is a tool aimed at individuals and organiz
ations concerned with identifying and monitoring the extent of Forest Cover Loss.



# How it works
The Forest Cover Reporting tool consists of a dashboard that receives alerts on forest cover loss from the Global Forest Watch (an external API) and an SMS module that relays alerts as text messages to the concerned Community Forest Association Representatives. CFA Reps will receive points based on their activity over time. These points will translate to cryptocurrency tokens, farming implements, or direct cash to the CFA Repsâ€™ mobile number.

The dashboard is intended for use by an Administrator from one of the organizations earlier described, who:
- Views all alerts received from GFW
- Adds, and manages CFA Reps
- Views and Exchanges feedback with CFA Reps

The SMS module serves as the reporting channel that: 
- Relays alerts from the Dashboard to the CFA Reps
- Aggregates feedback from CFA Reps
